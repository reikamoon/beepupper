## Description
**Status: In progress**

## :bee:What is BeePupper?:dog:
BeePupper is a handy tool for those who enjoy cooking. With features such as to-do lists for recipes, shopping lists that calculates the costs of all your ingredients, and handy tools such as a sales calculator and a cooking timer.\
BeePupper is a collab of [HolyPi](https://github.com/HolyPi?before=Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK5MjAxOS0wOS0wM1QyMToxNjoyNi0wNzowMM4MQ-iS&tab=repositories)'s CookHelper:dog: and [reikamoon](https://github.com/reikamoon/busybee)'s to-do list app, :bee:busybee.\
Tech Stack: Flask, MongoDB, Javascript

**What you hope to achieve: To help people cook, and make a complete functional project.**

## Challenges I Anticipate

**For challenges, working with the database is what comes to mind. Another challenge anticipated would
be deciding some of the Frontend aspects.**

## Skateboard
**Users can add two types of lists: shopping lists, and recipes.**

## Bike
**Implement tools such as sales calculator and cooking timer.**

## Car
**Add an existing API that will let users search for recipes (e,g: Spoonacular).**


## Personal Achievement Goals:

**Each teammate must achieve 2 of 3 of their self-set personal achievement goals. If you're not on a team, delete the other teammate sections as needed.**

### Joanelly :strawberry:

1. Make an interesting and engaging user interface.
2. Be able to implement an API.
3. Make a functional search function.

### Anjelica :ribbon:

1. Create a recipe list using Javascript.
2. Implement two databases (one for shopping lists, and the other for recipes).
3. Improve styling of webpages.

### Padyn :chicken:

1. Implement UX/UI that is more advanced than previous projects.
2. Be able to help implement an API.
3. Plan out how I will split my time between implementing both backend and frontend.
